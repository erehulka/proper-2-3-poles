## Proper (2,3)-Poles Analysis

### About the Project

This project provides an algorithm to generate proper (2,3)-poles from given snarks, analyze their color properties, and save the results in a CSV file. It was created as the main tool for Erik Å˜ehulka's bachelor's thesis on the "Analysis of Color Properties of Proper (2, 3)-Poles."

To run this program, you need to have the [ba_graph](https://bitbucket.org/relatko/ba-graph/src/master/) library installed on your computer.

### Installation

To install the project, start by creating the Makefile by running `cp Makefile.dist Makefile`. Next, replace `<path to ba graph library>` with the absolute path to the _ba_graph_ library on your computer. Then, to compile the program, run `make all`.

### Running the Analysis

This algorithm uses files with graphs in graph6 format, with each graph on a separate line. These files are typically stored in the `inputs` directory created during installation, or `inputs_bicritical` to analyze bicritical snarks. There are several ways to run the algorithm:

- Run `make run_all_inputs`. This will run the algorithm for each file in the `inputs` folder and save the outputs in the `outputs` folder.
- Run `make run_all_bicritical_inputs`. This will run the algorithm for each file in the `inputs_bicritical` folder and save the outputs in the `outputs_bicritical` folder.
- Run `./main.out <input file relative path> <output directory relative path>`. This will run the algorithm for the given file and save the outputs in the provided output directory. For example, `./main.out ./inputs/graph.g6 ./outputs/`.
